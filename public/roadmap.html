                <br>
                <br>The following schedule is based on general research and analysis of your project along with context gained from our conversations. 
                The goals that you want to achieve with the implementation of the project can be broken down to the following:
            <ul>
                <li>Create a network of boat and yacht owners who are looking to rent their vehicle for a variety of events</li>
                <li>Create an network of users who are interested in booking a boat, yacht or other types of nautical vehicles for recreational purposes.</li>
                <li>Create a community that connects these 2 networks.</li>
                <li>Achieve maximum return on investment</li>
            </ul>
            <p>As a consultancy with a focus on return on investment, <strong>Bright Ideas</strong> is dedicated to creating a robust, highly scalable applications that 
              will allow you to focus on securing clients and building a community with the confidence that users will have a consistent, immersive 
              experience each time they visit Book A Boat.
            <p>To achieve the above objectives, we divide the upcoming project into 5 sections:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Planning & Requirements Analysis</li>
                <li>Design</li>

                screen layouts, business rules, process diagrams and other documentation. The output of this stage will describe the new system as a collection of modules or subsystems.

                The elements created during the design stage are largely derived from the approved requirements that we create during the planning phase. 
                For each requirement, one or more design elements will be produced. At the end of this phase (typically 1-2 weeks), our deliverable will be a 
                prototype that will accurately depict the functionality, flow and overall structure that should be expected when interacting with the real application. 
                Our preferred tool to create prototypes is <a href="http://www.invisionapp.com/">Invision</a>.

                    the findings gained in the previous sections as well as the design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During this phase, we perform the actual coding. We will employ a test-driven development process
                    to ensure the validity of the code that we write as we write it as opposed to solely relying on
                    testing afterwards. This process will severely decrease the potential for bugs that would need to
                    be addressed post-deployment.
                </p>
                <p>In addition, we will develop a number of <a href="#infrastructure">cloud-hosted services</a> that will allow seamless communication
                    between the front-end client and the backend infrastructure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, we will style the applications such that a consistency of design is maintained across each platform.
                    This is typically the longest phase of the application development process.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our objective is to create a solid foundation by building an application that is highly scalable once
                    demand increases and new features are added. Also, the code base will be well-documented for the purpose
                    of optimal maintainability.

                <p>
                    Smartphone users have grown to expect certain functionality when viewing content on their devices. In order to remain competitive,
                    it is imperative that these expected behaviors are incorporated into the application while also pushing the envelope by incorporating 
                    cutting-edge features that are made available to developers for implementation in applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The native (mobile) application, in the same vein as Uber, will enable Customers to book services while also giving Owners the abiilty to easily
                  manage service requests that have been made for their boat, yacht, jet skis, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We will leverage <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/" target="_blank">React Native</a>,
                    an immensely popular JavaScript framework that was created by members of the team at Facebook, to build the application.
                    React Native will allow us to build one application that will run on <a href="#">iOS</a>
                    and <a href="#">Android</a> platforms, respectively. As previously stated, it is
                    imperative that we maintain integrity across platforms in terms of design.

              <p>In addition to the native application that will connect Customers and Owners, an accompanying web application must be built.
                Similar to <a href="http://www.uber.com"></a>Uber's</a> website, the main objective of the web application will be to serve as  
                a source of information to the potential Owners and Customers. Customers will have the ability to manage reservations, payment 
                options and review excursion history. Also, an <strong>Admin Dashboard</strong> will be built for Owners that will enable them to 
                view their payouts along with a variety of analytics seamlessly. The details here are TBD and requirements will be fleshed out in such a way 
                that we build according to what we learn from the users' interaction with the application. 
              </p>
              <p>
                  We will leverage <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/" target="_blank">React</a>, the web-focused companion to React Native, 
                  to build the web application. Becasue these frameworks are loosely coupled, several elements of the web and native applications can be shared
                  and reused across platforms. This will yield tighter integration and aloow for rapid application development.
              </p>

            By using open web-standards and employing software development best practices, we will create an engaging experience

        </p>
        <p class="proposal-content">In order to adhere to the proposed schedule, we estimate a budget of $50,000.
            Here is an itemized breakdown:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>$10000 - UI/UX Development</li>

            <li>$10000 - Website Application Design and Development</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We request a $10,000 down payment to begin the <a href="#design">UI/UX Design</a> phase. Subsequent payments would be spread out evenly over the next 10 months. 
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, we request a 30% equity stake in the company, which will be earmarked for future members of the development team. The 
          shares would vest over a period TBD. The main objective for this approach is be a bit proactive in the way that we incentivize potential
          talent to come on board during the recruitment process. 
          <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-05/a-9-500-stock-surge-turns-janitors-into-millionaires-in-china" target="_blank">This Chinese company</a> took a similar approach which I believe will become more 
          commonplace in the future.  
        </p>
        <p class="proposal-content">
          From the start of the project to our first deployment to the App Stores, we estimate 18-24 weeks. The objective at that point will be to launch
          v1, achieve market validation and gain traction with Owners and Customers.
